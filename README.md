# LaneWise – A Smart Traffic Lane Decision Tool

**LaneWise** is a real-time traffic lane decision tool that helps drivers choose the optimal lane on highways, such as I-93, by analyzing live webcam feeds or uploaded traffic footage. The tool uses clustering techniques to group lanes based on traffic density and vehicle speed, providing lane recommendations to minimize time spent in traffic.

## Project Description

I am developing LaneWise to help drivers select the best lane based on real-time traffic conditions. The system uses clustering techniques to analyze lane congestion and vehicle speed, providing recommendations to minimize time spent in traffic. By leveraging live traffic data and user-uploaded footage, LaneWise analyzes and ranks lanes dynamically.

## Goals

- Provide real-time lane recommendations by analyzing traffic density and vehicle speed.
- Use clustering techniques to group lanes based on their current traffic conditions.
- Minimize time spent in traffic by recommending the least congested, fastest lane.

## Data Collection

- **Source:** 
  - webcam data (images) from Public APIs or user-uploaded traffic footage.
- **Format:** 
  - Images or video footage showing highway lanes.
- **Collection Method:** 
  - Periodic scraping of live webcam feeds or accepting video uploads from users.

## Data Modeling

- **Vehicle Detection and Lane Segmentation:** 
  - I will use OpenCV to detect vehicles and segment lanes within the image or video footage.
- **Clustering Techniques:**
  - I will apply simple clustering methods, such as K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering, to group lanes based on:
    - Vehicle density (number of vehicles per lane).
    - Average vehicle speed per lane.
  - The system will classify lanes into low, medium, or high congestion clusters, and recommend the lane in the least congested cluster.
- **Lane Ranking:** 
  - Lanes will be ranked based on their cluster, with lanes in the "low congestion" cluster being prioritized.

## Visualization

- **Frontend Visualization:**
  - The web interface will display traffic footage with color-coded lane overlays (e.g., green for low congestion, red for high congestion).
- **Clustering Results:** 
  - I will use a bar chart or pie chart to show relative congestion levels based on clustering results.
- **Table View:** 
  - A table will display each lane’s vehicle count, speed, and cluster assignment, along with the recommended lane.

## Test Plan

- **Unit Testing:** 
  - I will test vehicle detection, lane segmentation, and clustering algorithms with pre-recorded traffic footage.
- **Validation:** 
  - I will manually validate clustering results by comparing the system's lane recommendations with actual traffic conditions during peak times.
- **Test Dataset:** 
  - I will test the system on footage from various traffic scenarios (light, moderate, and heavy traffic) to ensure robustness.
- **A/B Testing:** 
  - I will compare lane recommendations generated by the system with actual traffic outcomes or third-party traffic reports to measure accuracy.
